# REDO Assessment: Anti-Reproductive Rights Crimes & Domestic Violence Related Calls Analysis

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project presents a robust, ethical, and fully reproducible analysis of anti-reproductive rights crimes and domestic violence incidents in California. Leveraging advanced data science techniquesâ€”including EDA, clustering, and classificationâ€”itâ€™s designed for **one-click execution** via Docker, with no manual setup or path adjustments required.

- **Step-by-step analysis and detailed explanations are available in:**
  - `part-1.ipynb` (Anti-Reproductive Rights Crimes)
  - `part-2.ipynb` (Domestic Violence Calls)

- **Interactive Visual Exploration:**
  - A Streamlit web app is included for dynamic, visual data analysis. With Docker, you can launch a web interface to:
    - Upload and explore datasets
    - Evaluate data quality and missing values
    - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    - Run clustering and classification models
    - Visualize outputs (PCA, feature importance, confusion matrices, etc.)
    - Review ethical considerations and references
  - This makes the project approachable for both technical and non-technical users.
